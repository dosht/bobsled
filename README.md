# Project Demos Readme

## 1. [GCS Bucket File Management with Google Cloud Functions and Terraform](https://github.com/dosht/bobsled/tree/main/cloudfunction-terraform-demo)
This project showcases the use of two Google Cloud Functions deployed via Terraform. These functions generate pre-signed URLs for seamless uploading and downloading of files to and from a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. The implementation facilitates efficient file management in cloud environments, enhancing the accessibility and security of data within the GCS bucket.

## 2. [Cloudrun with IAP and Terraform Demo](https://github.com/dosht/bobsled/tree/main/iap-cloudrun-terraform-demo)
Experience the power of Google Cloud Run with Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) in this demonstration. Leveraging Terraform for infrastructure as code, this project deploys a Cloud Run service secured by IAP. This setup ensures secure and authenticated access to your applications, providing a robust and scalable solution for containerized applications in a serverless environment.

## 3. [Kubernetes with IAP, Kustomize, Ingress, DNS, and TLS Demo](https://github.com/dosht/bobsled/tree/main/iap-k8s-demo)
Explore the orchestration capabilities of Kubernetes with a comprehensive demonstration. This project combines Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) for secure access, Kustomize for Kubernetes configuration management, Ingress for routing, and DNS and TLS for enhanced security. The result is a well-architected Kubernetes deployment showcasing best practices in container orchestration and cloud-native application development.

## 4. [Spark Job with Domain-Driven Design and TDD Demo](https://github.com/dosht/bobsled/tree/main/spark-domain-driven-design-demo)
This project showcases the use of Apache Spark that integrates Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodologies. The Spark job demonstrates a structured and efficient approach to big data processing, emphasizing maintainability and scalability through domain-driven design and rigorous testing practices.

## 5. [Sensor Fusion with Functional Programming](https://github.com/dosht/bobsled/tree/main/sensor-fusion)
This project showcases how functional programming concepts enhance the accuracy and reliability of sensor data calculations. By adopting a functional approach, the demo emphasizes modularity and composability, making sensor data fusion more robust and adaptable to various scenarios.

## 6. [Data Engineering Project Demo: Applepen Retail Network](https://github.com/dosht/bobsled/tree/main/online-retail)
This ia a data engineering project centered around the Applepen retail network. This demo encapsulates over a decade of successful operation, managing retail stores across different parts of the United States. The project involves data engineering tasks such as processing sales data, managing inventory, and extracting valuable insights to support the sustained success of the Applepen retail business.
